<p>
Ho-ho-ho-holy Moly, what a year! 
</p>
<p>
We've absolutely loved our first year in the Ozark town of Eureka Springs. 
Thank you to everyone who helped us settle in, warmed up our house and hearts, tested our guest rooms,
and welcomed us into this ridiculously adorable and magical
community. You’ve paved the way for next year’s visitors. They
thank you.
</p>
<p>
Our favorite highlight has been our new puppy (Goldie Han) Solo from cousins in Omaha. 
She melts our hearts every single day. 
</p>
<p>
Kris has been holding down the fort, playing in the woods and slowly but surely building out our music/recording space. Jewel completed her certification in <a href="https://somaticintuitivehealing.com/">Somatic Intuitive Healing</a>, performed as <a href="https://kimnema.com">KÍmNEMÁ</a> in Portland with a full choir including her best friend, volunteers with Eureka Springs Main Street and with <a href="https://www.score.org/">SCORE</a> as a business mentor, is building a holistic collective for <a href="https://www.unstrucksanctuary.com/">Healed Leadership</a>, and loves introductions to fellow entrepreneurs.
</p>
<p>
Once again, we’re pulling <a href="https://soundcloud.com/juellez/its-krismas-again">a holiday song out of the archives</a>—from
our favorite old timey monikers, Kris ‘n Miss Jewel. 
Cheers to singing and dancing like nobody's watching&mdash;and the best year yet ;)
</p>

<a class="button" href="https://www.icloud.com/sharedalbum/#B0sJEsNWnJtISCz">2023 Photo Highlights</a></p>
<p>

					This year we found ourselves amidst LOTS of change, transition, goodbyes, and new beginnings. Jewel completed two year-long trainings for her new path in somatic coaching and healing, Kris shut down his recording studio of 15 years (The Map Room), and together we put Kris' home on the market and Jewel's up for rent&mdash;and bought a new home (The Garden Palace) in the Ozarks, on the outskirts of Eureka Springs, AR. 
<br><br>

					We are grateful to have spent so much time with extended family and friends, including a trip to Rocky National Park for Kris' parent's 50<sup>th</sup> anniversary and to Iowa for a Mlnarik family reunion to celebrate a 50<sup>th</sup> birthday (where we also got to drop in on friends in Des Moines). 

<br><br>
					Jewel also enjoyed a train trip with her dad and aunt to North Hampton for cousin Sarah & Jon's wedding, a friend visit to London and Ireland, several trips near Sacramento to visit her mom & brother James, and the bay area to her cousin Tricia (thanks to her girls for graciously sharing their room and artwork!) 
<br><br>

					We hosted Jewel's sister Jenni and fam in the summer, right before hosting Jewel's brother Jake w/his fiance Ivory and Kris's brother Hunter for Pickathon. Additional musical highlights include seeing the Wooten brothers in Seattle and spending Easter with Jewel's uncle Rick and cousins Tom & Nick&mdash;and two Folk & Forage festivals, along with several Portland shows. Kris got to drop in on Jenni & Dave's band practice en route to our new home (thanks to Ezra for sharing his room!)
<br><br>
					--><!-- 
					It was at Kris's family trip in June that we decided to trade the NW Pacific for NW Arkansas and announce our plans to move. Naturally, it meant we should visit and make sure this spot on a map would work for us. So we flew out for Labor Day weekend to scout and one syncronicity led to another and before we could believe it, we put an offer in on a house and got it. We got Kris's house ready for market in September; Jewel flew out in October to get the new keys and mow the yard; movers hauled our furniture and Kris drove across the country to start getting us settled in in Nov; and then Jewel got her house ready for renters and hit the road in December.
					<br><br> --><!--

					Countless friends and family pitched in to help us&mdash;and words can barely do justice to express our gratitude. As we continue to get settled and find our stationary, we look forward to writing and hosting and making more music together.
<br><br>

					Until then, please know that you're in our hearts. And may you enjoy a little Christmas ditty from last year ;-)

				<h2>ps.</h2>
				<p>Life is hard, you are loved, life is beautiful, and we all deserve to live in <em>Beloved Community</em>. 
				May winter (for those of you in the Northern Hemisphere) bring deserved rest, reflection, hibernation, and tranquility to appreciate the sounds within silence, the warmth within a huddle and your own hands, 
				and what we need (and don't) to feel deserving of Love, of which we can't overdose. <nobr><sub>&#10084;</sub>&#10084;<sup>&#10084;</sup></nobr></p>
